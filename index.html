He asked what would happen if we arranged all the vectors in a path in all the possible ways. Well, you get a line, then a square, then a cube, and then hypercubes of n dimensions to infinity. See the result on the background of this page. Fun!</p>

            <p>I spent two years developing and teaching amazing young students in an innovative elementary school. We learned how to count in ancient number systems and different bases, and we even created our own number systems. We learned about buildings and different cultures, pollution and biomagnification, and evolution and imagined alien habitats. It was a really great opportunity to do things I never thought possible with young students.</p>

            <h3>🦠Neurons: Evolutionary Spiking Neural Network {2018-2019}</h3>
            <p>This was my first attempt at AI. And, of course, I didn't want to learn TensorFlow. No, I wanted to make a spiking neural network from scratch. Thousands of lines of code later, I had self-assembling clusters of spiking neurons evolving using genetic exchange.</p>
            <p>It was object oriented using multithreading in Java, and performance was good, yet it was held back by the cluster structure. I don't see a use in continuing unless I were to create a visual tool for people to learn about creating and training neural networks. Unless I receive funding for such a program, it's not going to happen.</p>
            <p>One interesting development: At one point, the neural networks found a flaw in my culling algorithm and started evolving to consume nearly all 24GB of my computer's memory with their massive population. Evolution always finds a way.</p>

            <p>This is a VR simulation where you could take on the role of any character in any play and act in that role. I collaborated with Garrett Munro on this idea and created a scripting language so he could direct any play he liked. The project was a working proof concept, and I'd like to develop it further.</p>

            <p>For four years, I was lucky enough to work with a wonderful team developing science curriculum and assessments. We created project-based, vertically-integrated, and horizontally-integrated assessments that guided students through a process of self-discovery and exploration. By the end of the program, students were able to imagine and implement unique and authentic science projects. I am grateful for this opportunity to have served my students, many of whom have gone on to study at the best universities in the world. And to all my former students, I hope you are well. May you find and pursue many wonderful opportunities.</p>
