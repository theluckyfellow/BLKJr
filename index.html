        <h3>🔬🔢Elementory Inquiry Based Science and Math{2020-2022}</h3>
        <p>I spent two years developing and teaching amazing young student in an inovative elementary school. I we learned how to count in ancient number system and diffent bases, and we even created our own number systems. We learned about buildins and different cultures, pullotion and biomagntifcation, and evolution and imagined alien habitats. It was a really great opportunity to do thing I never though possible with young students.</p>

            <h3>🦠Neurons: Evoltionary Spiking Neural Network {2018-2019}</h3>
            <p>This was my first attempt at AI. And of course I didn't want to just learn TensorFlow. No, I wanted to make a spiking neural network from scratch. Thounsands of lines of code later, I had self assembling clusters of spiking neurons evolving using sexual reproduction.<br> It was object oriented using multitheading in Java and performance was good, yet it was held back by the cluster structure. I don't see a use in continuing unless I were to create visual tool for people to learn about creating and training neural networks. Unless I recieve funding for such a program, it's not going to happen.<br>One last interesting thing. At one point they found a flaw in my culling algorithm and started evolving to consum all 24GB of my computer's memory with their massive population. Evoltion always finds a way. </p>

            <p>This is a VR simulation where you could take on the role of any character in any play and act in that role. I collaborated with my a friend on this idea and created a scripting language so he could direct any play he liked. The project was mostly a proof of concept and needs more polish.</p>

            <p>For four years I was lucky enough to work with wonderful team developing Science circulm and assessments. We were able to create project based verticlely and hozontially ingregated assessments that guided students through a process of self discovery and exploration. By the end of the program students were able to imagine and impliment unique and authentic science projects. I am grateful for this opporunity to serve students who went on to many of the best universities in the world. And to all my former students, I hope you are well, may you find and take many wonderful opportunities.</p>
